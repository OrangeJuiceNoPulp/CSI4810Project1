# CSI4810Project1
Project 1 for the course CSI 4810, focusing on classifying forest cover type from cartographic variables.


This project uses datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data. This data is contained in train.csv and test.csv files.

The logistic_regression.csv, kNN.csv, decision_tree.csv, and random_forest.csv files contain the output of various predictor models using the data in the test.csv file. The details for the selection of these models and their parameters are included in the project report document.

To run the demo application, run all the cells in the gradio_app Jupyter Notebook file from top to bottom. 

The miscCode Notebook file contains miscellaneous code used for ensuring various properties about the training dataset. The CreateTestCSV Notebook file contains the code used to create the previously mentioned csv files using the test dataset.
